# 3D Printed Enclosures

This folder contains designs for 3D printing enclosures for the D1 Mini and motion sensors, and the WLED controller using a full size ElectroCookie prototype board.  These were printed with PLA on an Ender 3 Pro.  You can see how the enclosures were used in the build video [Motion activated LED stair lighting... without staircase modification!](https://youtu.be/Y29Y0iTLggg)
