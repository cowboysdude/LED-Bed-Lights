  I have changed the effect to solid and dimmed the color because I didn't want to blind myself at night :)

More information on installation of the code in Home Assistant can be found in the Home Assistant folder.

This version does require Home Assistant.  For a standalone version that doesn't require Home Assistant or any other hubs or systems, albeit with few features and effects than this version, please see this repository: [Standalone Motion-Activated LED Controller](https://github.com/Resinchem/standalone-led-controller)
